<h2>How it works</h2>
The user may enter any burger name to add to the menu. This adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is added as available on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it, which moves that clicked burger into the adjacent column and updates its status accordingly in the database. The user may also delete the burger to clear it from the field.
